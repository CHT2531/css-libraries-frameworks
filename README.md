# CSS Libraries and frameworks

## Using a library (e.g. Animate.css)
* Have a look at Animate.css (https://animate.style/)
* See if you can get a basic example working that uses this library. 

## Using a framework (e.g. Bootstrap)
* Have a look at Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)
* Again see if you can get a basic example working
  * Once Bootstrap works, see if you can implement a simply page layout or navigation bar using Bootstrap (Have a look under components). 
  * One way to understand Bootstrap is by looking at some examples and modifying these. See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/
* We can customise Bootstrap by downloading the sources files and editing the Sass code. See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/download/
